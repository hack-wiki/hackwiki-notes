# Reverse Engineering

## Overview

Reverse engineering malware involves disassembling and decompiling binaries to
understand their internal logic — control flow, algorithms, encryption
routines, C2 protocols, and evasion techniques. This is the deepest level of
malware analysis, used when static and dynamic analysis alone cannot fully
explain a sample's behavior.

## Topics in This Section

- [Disassembly & Decompilation](disassembly.md) — using Ghidra, radare2, and
  other tools to convert machine code back to assembly and pseudocode
- [Debugging Techniques](debugging.md) — stepping through malware execution
  with GDB and x64dbg to observe runtime state
- [Anti-Analysis Techniques](anti-analysis.md) — common evasion techniques
  malware uses to thwart analysis, and how to defeat them
- [.NET & Java Reversing](dotnet-java.md) — decompiling managed code with
  specialized tools (dnSpy, jadx)

## General Approach

1. **Disassemble** — load the binary into a disassembler to view assembly code
2. **Identify key functions** — find entry points, main logic, and interesting
   routines (crypto, networking, persistence)
3. **Decompile** — use decompiler output for higher-level understanding
4. **Debug** — set breakpoints at key locations and step through execution
5. **Defeat anti-analysis** — patch or bypass packing, anti-debugging, and
   environment checks
6. **Document** — record findings on malware capabilities, IOCs, and C2
   protocols
