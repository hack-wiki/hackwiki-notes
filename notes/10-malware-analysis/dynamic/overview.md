# Dynamic Analysis

## Overview

Dynamic analysis executes a malware sample in a controlled environment and
observes its behavior — filesystem changes, registry modifications, network
communications, process creation, and API calls. Dynamic analysis reveals
runtime behavior that static analysis cannot, especially for packed, encrypted,
or obfuscated samples.

## Topics in This Section

- [Sandbox Setup](01-sandbox-setup.md) — building isolated analysis environments
  with VMs, snapshots, and network simulation
- [Behavioral Analysis](02-behavioral-analysis.md) — monitoring filesystem,
  registry, process, and system-level changes during execution
- [Network Traffic Analysis](04-network-analysis.md) — capturing and analyzing
  malware C2 communications, DNS queries, and data exfiltration
- [API Call Monitoring](03-api-monitoring.md) — tracing system calls and API
  usage with strace, ltrace, and Frida

## General Approach

1. **Prepare** — set up an isolated VM with snapshots, configure network
   monitoring
2. **Execute** — run the sample while monitoring tools capture activity
3. **Observe** — watch for filesystem, registry, network, and process changes
4. **Capture** — save network traffic, API traces, and behavioral logs
5. **Analyze** — correlate observations to understand malware capabilities
6. **Restore** — revert the VM to a clean snapshot after analysis
