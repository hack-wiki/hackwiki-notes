# Static Analysis

## Overview

Static analysis examines a malware sample without executing it — identifying
file types, extracting strings and metadata, analyzing imports and exports,
inspecting PE/ELF headers, and detecting packers or obfuscation. Static
analysis is the first phase of any malware investigation and provides initial
indicators of compromise (IOCs) and behavioral hypotheses.

## Topics in This Section

- [File Identification & Triage](01-file-identification.md) — file type detection,
  hashing, fuzzy hashing, metadata extraction, and initial triage
- [PE File Analysis](04-pe-analysis.md) — Windows PE header analysis, sections,
  imports/exports, resources, and anomaly detection
- [ELF File Analysis](05-elf-analysis.md) — Linux ELF header analysis, sections,
  symbols, and dynamic linking
- [Strings & Import Analysis](02-strings-imports.md) — extracting readable strings,
  analyzing API imports, and identifying capabilities
- [Packer Detection & Unpacking](03-packer-detection.md) — detecting packed or
  obfuscated binaries and unpacking techniques

## General Approach

1. **Identify** — determine file type, architecture, and format
2. **Hash** — compute MD5/SHA-256/ssdeep for IOC sharing and VirusTotal lookup
3. **Triage** — quick metadata scan to determine if the sample warrants deeper
   analysis
4. **Analyze headers** — inspect PE/ELF structures for anomalies
5. **Extract strings** — look for URLs, IPs, commands, registry keys, file paths
6. **Review imports** — identify suspicious API calls that reveal capabilities
7. **Check for packing** — detect and unpack if necessary before deeper analysis
