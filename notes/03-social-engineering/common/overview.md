# Social Engineering Methodology

## Overview

Social engineering exploits human trust, authority, and urgency to gain
unauthorized access to systems, information, or physical spaces. In authorized
penetration testing, SE assessments measure an organization's human-layer
defenses — security awareness training effectiveness, policy adherence, and
incident reporting culture.

SE testing requires explicit written authorization separate from technical
testing scope. Techniques target people, not systems, and carry unique ethical
and legal obligations.
