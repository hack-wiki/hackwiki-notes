# Methodologies

## Overview

Structured testing methodologies provide repeatable frameworks for
security assessments. Each methodology page outlines the phases,
objectives, key activities, and deliverables for a specific engagement
type. These are high-level workflows — tool-specific details are
covered in the corresponding section files.
