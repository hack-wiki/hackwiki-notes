# Red Team Operations

## Overview

Red team operations simulate real-world adversaries to test an organization's detection and response capabilities. Unlike penetration testing which focuses on finding vulnerabilities, red teaming focuses on achieving objectives while evading detection. Operations require careful planning, strict operational security, and thorough reporting.

- [Operational Security](opsec.md)
- [Threat Emulation](threat-emulation.md)
- [Exfiltration](exfiltration.md)
- [Reporting](reporting.md)

## General Approach

1. **Plan the campaign** — define objectives, scope, rules of engagement, threat model
2. **Build infrastructure** — set up C2, redirectors, domains, payloads
3. **Execute with OPSEC** — operate under strict operational security discipline
4. **Achieve objectives** — demonstrate impact through data collection and exfiltration
5. **Report findings** — deliver actionable findings focused on detection gaps
