# Introduction to Penetration Testing

## Overview

Penetration testing (pentesting) is the practice of simulating real-world attacks against systems, networks, and applications to identify security weaknesses before adversaries do. It requires a blend of technical skills across multiple domains — no single area of expertise is sufficient.

This page outlines the foundational knowledge required to begin learning penetration testing effectively. These are not optional extras — they are the baseline that separates productive learning from frustration.

## Prerequisites

### Systems Administration

A solid understanding of how operating systems work is essential. Pentesters exploit misconfigurations, weak defaults, and design flaws — recognizing them requires knowing what "normal" looks like.

**Linux fundamentals:**

- Filesystem hierarchy (`/etc`, `/var`, `/tmp`, `/home`, `/proc`)
- Process management (`ps`, `top`, `kill`, signals)
- User and group permissions (ownership, SUID/SGID bits, `chmod`, `chown`)
- Service management (systemd: `systemctl`, `journalctl`; non-systemd distros use OpenRC/SysV/runit)
- Scheduled tasks (`cron`, `at`)
- Package management (Debian/Ubuntu: `apt`; RHEL/Fedora/CentOS: `dnf`/`yum`)
- Log locations and formats (Debian/Ubuntu: `/var/log/auth.log`, `/var/log/syslog`; RHEL-like: `/var/log/secure`, `/var/log/messages`; systemd-only: `journalctl`)

**Windows fundamentals:**

- Architecture basics (Registry, SAM, LSASS, Windows services)
- User and group management (local accounts, domain accounts, built-in groups)
- Privilege model (UAC, integrity levels, access tokens)
- File system permissions (NTFS ACLs, inheritance)
- Scheduled tasks and startup locations
- Event Logs (Security, System, Application)
- PowerShell basics for administration

### Networking

Networking is the backbone of most penetration tests. Without a clear understanding of how systems communicate, identifying attack vectors becomes guesswork.

**Core concepts:**

- OSI and TCP/IP models — understand which protocols operate at which layers
- IP addressing and subnetting (CIDR notation, subnet masks, broadcast addresses)
- TCP vs UDP — connection-oriented vs connectionless, the three-way handshake
- Common protocols and their default ports (SSH/22, HTTP/80, HTTPS/443, SMB/445, RDP/3389, DNS/53)
- DNS resolution process (recursive queries, zone transfers, record types)
- ARP, DHCP, and how local network communication works
- Basic routing and NAT concepts
- Packet capture and analysis fundamentals (Wireshark, tcpdump)

### Programming and Scripting

You do not need to be a software developer, but you do need to read and write code. Scripting automates repetitive tasks, helps you understand exploits, and lets you modify tools to fit specific engagements.

**Recommended starting point:**

- **Python** — the de facto language for security tooling. Automating scans, writing custom exploits, parsing output, interacting with APIs
- **Bash** — essential for chaining commands, writing quick one-liners, and automating Linux tasks
- **PowerShell** — critical for Windows environments, Active Directory enumeration, and post-exploitation

**What to focus on:**

- Reading and modifying existing scripts (more common than writing from scratch)
- String manipulation, file I/O, network sockets
- Understanding how exploits work at a code level (buffer overflows, injection payloads)
- Regex basics for log parsing and pattern matching

### Security Fundamentals

Before attacking systems, understand the landscape you operate in.

**Threat landscape:**

- Who are the adversaries — cybercriminals (ransomware gangs, initial access brokers), nation-state actors (APTs), hacktivists, insider threats
- Motivation matters — financial gain, espionage, disruption, ideology
- Attack trends — supply chain attacks, ransomware-as-a-service, credential theft at scale

**Attack frameworks:**

- **Cyber Kill Chain** (Lockheed Martin) — reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command & control, actions on objectives. Useful for understanding the attacker's progression
- **MITRE ATT&CK** — a knowledge base of real-world adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Mapped by tactic (what the attacker wants to achieve) and technique (how they achieve it). The industry standard for describing adversary behavior

**Penetration testing methodology:**

- **Pre-engagement** — scope definition, rules of engagement, legal authorization
- **Reconnaissance** — passive and active information gathering
- **Enumeration** — detailed service and vulnerability discovery
- **Exploitation** — gaining initial access
- **Post-exploitation** — privilege escalation, lateral movement, data collection
- **Reporting** — documenting findings with evidence and remediation guidance

### Security Principles

Core security principles guide both defenders and attackers. Understanding them helps you identify where they are violated — which is exactly where vulnerabilities live.

- **Principle of least privilege** — users and processes should have only the minimum permissions required to perform their function. Violations are a primary source of privilege escalation paths
- **Separation of duties** — no single individual should control all aspects of a critical process. In technical terms: the web server should not run as root, the backup admin should not be the domain admin
- **Defense in depth** — multiple layers of security controls so that the failure of one does not compromise the whole system. Attackers look for single points of failure
- **Need-to-know / compartmentalization** — information access restricted to those who require it. Excessive access leads to data exfiltration opportunities
- **Fail-safe defaults** — systems should deny access by default and grant it explicitly. Misconfigured defaults (open ports, default credentials, permissive ACLs) are among the most common findings in penetration tests

### Security Tools

Familiarity with both hardware and software security controls helps you understand what you are up against — and what you are trying to bypass.

**Network security:**

- Firewalls (packet filtering, stateful inspection, next-gen)
- IDS/IPS (Snort, Suricata — signature-based vs anomaly-based)
- Network segmentation (VLANs, DMZ architecture)
- VPN and encrypted tunnels

**Endpoint security:**

- Antivirus and EDR solutions (Windows Defender, CrowdStrike, SentinelOne)
- Host-based firewalls and application whitelisting
- Full disk encryption (BitLocker, LUKS)

**Identity and access:**

- Active Directory and Group Policy
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- PAM (Privileged Access Management) solutions

Understanding these controls is essential — not just to bypass them during engagements, but to recommend improvements in your reports.

## Where to Start

There is no single correct path, but a practical approach:

1. **Build a home lab** — install VMs (Kali Linux, Windows Server, Ubuntu) and practice in a controlled environment
2. **Learn Linux first** — most pentest tools run on Linux, and many targets are Linux-based
3. **Practice on intentionally vulnerable platforms** — Hack The Box, TryHackMe, VulnHub, PortSwigger Web Security Academy
4. **Follow a structured methodology** — avoid random tool usage. Work through reconnaissance → enumeration → exploitation systematically
5. **Read reports** — published penetration test reports teach you what professional output looks like
6. **Get certified when ready** — certifications like OSCP, eJPT, or CompTIA PenTest+ validate skills and provide structured learning paths
