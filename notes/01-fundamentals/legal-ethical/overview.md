# Legal and Ethical

## Overview

Legal and ethical considerations are the foundation of professional security work. The line between penetration testing and criminal hacking is authorization — without it, the same techniques that protect organizations become federal crimes. This section covers the legal frameworks, authorization requirements, engagement boundaries, and disclosure responsibilities that every security professional must understand before touching a keyboard.

## Topics in This Section

- [Authorization and Legal Framework](authorization.md) — Written authorization requirements, key legislation (CFAA, CMA, GDPR), cloud provider policies, liability, and pre-engagement checklists
- [Vulnerability Disclosure](disclosure.md) — Coordinated vs full vs private disclosure, reporting contacts, writing vulnerability reports, CVE process, and bug bounty programs
- [Rules of Engagement](rules-of-engagement.md) — Scope definition, testing windows, authorized techniques, communication plans, engagement types (black/gray/white/red), evidence handling, and deconfliction

## General Approach

Before any engagement:

1. **Authorization first** — obtain signed written permission from the asset owner
2. **Define the rules** — agree on scope, timing, techniques, and communication
3. **Test within boundaries** — when in doubt, stop and ask
4. **Report responsibly** — deliver findings securely, handle data with care
5. **Disclose appropriately** — follow coordinated disclosure for third-party vulnerabilities discovered during engagements
