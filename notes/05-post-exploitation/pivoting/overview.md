# Pivoting & Tunneling

## Overview

Pivoting routes traffic through a compromised host to reach internal networks that are not directly accessible from the attacker. When initial access lands on a DMZ or perimeter host, pivoting extends reach into internal segments — database servers, domain controllers, and management networks. Tunneling tools encapsulate traffic through the compromised host, creating a bridge between the attacker and internal systems.

- [Chisel](chisel.md)
- [Ligolo-ng](ligolo.md)
- [SSH Tunneling](ssh-tunneling.md)
- [Port Forwarding](port-forwarding.md)
- [SOCKS Proxy](socks-proxy.md)

## General Approach

1. **Map the network** — identify subnets reachable from the compromised host but not from the attacker
2. **Choose tunneling method** — SSH tunneling (if SSH available), Chisel/Ligolo-ng (binary transfer), or built-in tools
3. **Set up the tunnel** — establish reverse connection from compromised host to attacker
4. **Configure proxychains** — route tools through the SOCKS proxy to reach internal targets
5. **Enumerate internal network** — scan and enumerate through the tunnel
