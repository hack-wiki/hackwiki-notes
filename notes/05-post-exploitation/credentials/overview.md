# Credential Operations

## Overview

Credential operations cover the full lifecycle of credential harvesting and cracking after gaining access: extracting credentials from compromised systems (files, memory, registry), cracking password hashes offline, performing online brute-force attacks, and password spraying across networks. Credentials are the key to lateral movement — cracked hashes and harvested passwords unlock access to additional systems, services, and ultimately domain admin.

## General Approach

1. **Harvest** — extract credentials from the compromised system (files, memory, databases, registry)
2. **Identify** — determine hash types and which services they authenticate to
3. **Crack offline** — use hashcat or john against wordlists and rules
4. **Spray** — test discovered passwords against other accounts and services
5. **Pivot** — use cracked credentials for lateral movement
